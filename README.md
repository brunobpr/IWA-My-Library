MLO7 Assess the security needs of a web application to aid the development and integration of security measures.
Assignment Description
Choose an area of your interest to design, create and deploy an interactive web app that incorporates: [30%] Structured data stored in XML and/or JSON formats, where these files can be validated
(XSD/JSON Schema) and transformed to HTML for client-side consumption.
[30%] Retrieval and manipulation of this data on a server-side with Node.js and through the use
of appropriate modules.
[20%] Clean, intuitive and responsive user interface (Bootstrap) and appropriate visual
representation of the data on the client-side (CSS, JavaScript).
[10%] Security measures, such as validation of user input on the client-side (JavaScript) and
sanitisation of user input on the client-side (Node.js).
[10%] The finished application should be accompanied by a report (5 pages max) that outlines the idea behind your application, describes each of the technologies used and includes a short user manual (10%). The cover sheet for the report should include a full student name, student number, project title and the project’s GitHub repository link.

Additional Information
• This project is an individual project and you have all the freedom to work on a topic of your
interest.
• The application should be developed using an online IDE, such as Gitpod.io (the free tier includes 100 hours a month for developing/debugging/running you app), and all of your code from day one should be stored in your personal GitHub repository that is traceable, i.e. shows an adequate number of commits that go back to the very start of your project.
• All of the code and the report will be checked for plagiarism, so make sure everything is referenced through the use of comments. The code that is not referenced properly will not be marked and will be reported for plagiarism.
• Outside of special circumstances, any code submitted to GitHub after the deadline – will not be marked.
• Any other technical details that might come up during the course of this project should be clarified directly with your lecturer.
• A grading rubric for each of the grade items is outlined below. Please use this as a guide for the development of this project.
